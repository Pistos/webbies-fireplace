Webbies fireplace
========================

A set of server deployment scripts, initially targeted
at Webby's, but should work anywhere. 

To get started with deployment:

git clone git://github.com/mario/webbies-fireplace.git
cd webbies-fireplace/$stack
./build-$stack.sh

In some cases, you might need to do:

chmod +x build-$stack.sh
